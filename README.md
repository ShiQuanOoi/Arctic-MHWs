# Detect Marine Heatwaves in the Arctic region 

The codes were written for BSc Marine Science 4th year student dissertation project on mapping marine heatwaves in the Arctic region. The codes written in MATLAB were aimed to study the characteristics of MHWs in the region north of 60Â°N latitude from 1983 to 2012 (30 years). The MHW event is defined as an anomalously warm-water event lasting for at least 5 consecutive days with daily SST higher than the 90th percentile over a 30-year historical baseline period, and two successive events with a temporal gap of less than 3 days are to be treated as a single joint event (Hobday et al. 2016, pp. 227-238). 

Previous appraoches to detecting and analysing global MHWs had been done by Eric C. J. Oliver (2015) in python, Schlegel and Smit (2018) in R, and Zhao and Marin (2019) in MATLAB.
